Stateless vs. Stateful Session Bean
Now let’s have a look at the major difference between the two types of session beans.

5.1 Stateless Beans
Stateless session beans maintain no state with the client. For this reason, they can be used to create a pool of objects which interact with multiple clients
Since stateless beans don’t have any state per client, they are better performance wise
They can handle multiple requests from multiple clients in parallel and
Can be used for retrieving objects from databases


5.2 Stateful Beans
Stateful session beans can maintain state with multiple clients, and the task is not shared among clients
The state lasts for the duration of the session. After the session is destroyed, the state is not retained
The container can serialize and store the state as a stale state for future use. This is done to save application server resources and to support bean failures and is passivation
Can be used to solve producer-consumer type problems
